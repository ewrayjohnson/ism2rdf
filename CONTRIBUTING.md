- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Avoid introducing unused dependencies

## Testing Guidelines

- Run the transformer against multiple `.xsd` files
- Validate output formats (Turtle, JSON-LD, N-Triples)
- Check RDF validity using tools like [rdf-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdf-validate)
